1. I used the dionaea honey pot
2. Not many set up issues. I had to add an add in for the SDK, but that was my only major hiccupp. FOr some reason I only have one attack on my  machine as of typing this (Attack came from my Kali attacker VM). Not sure why there aren't more. 
3. One attack
4. Pretty sure I set this up correctly, but I have gotten 0 hits. Classmate of mine got 69k, so I know something is wrong. Just not what or why
